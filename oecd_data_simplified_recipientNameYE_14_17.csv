Sidas central organisational assessment (2015) concluded that UNHCRs systems for internal control are adequate according to Sidas assessment and in line with current contribution regulations.Sida provides multi-bilateral support (in addition to the MFA's annual core contribution) based on the UN Consolidated Appeals (HRP) and UNHCRs Global Appeal Supplementary Budget Appeals and UNHCR Regional Response Plans (RRRP). Sida allocates funding to UNHCR on a country / regional level and support is unearmarked at this level.

UNHCR is responsible for leading and coordinating the Global Protection Cluster (GPC) and the clusters of camp coordination and emergency shelter in situations of armed conflict and UNHCR contributes in this role to strategic coordination within the humanitarian system both at the global and country level. This support covers both new emergencies escalating humanitarian crises as well as protracted refugee situations and includes interventions in the sectors of shelter emergency shelter and multi-sector programmes (such as health nutrition food education water and sanitation).Land allocations for 2017 includes a total of 165 MSEK with support to: Algeria (Sahrawi refugees) 5 000 000 SEK; Burundi/Rwanda 5 000 000 SEK; Democratic Republic of Congo 10 000 000 SEK; Ethiopia 8 000 000 SEK; Iraq 14 000 000 SEK; Libya 5 000 000 SEK; Mali-situation 8 000 000 SEK; Somalia-situation 10 000 000 SEK; South Sudan 15 000 000 SEK; Syria 15 000 000 SEK; Syria-situation 30 000 000 SEK; Ukraine 10 000 000 SEK; Yemen 15 000 000 SEK SGBV strategy implementation 5 000 000 SEK. To facilitate rapid humanitarian planning and response payment of the full amount is made at the beginning of the year after signing of the Agreement and upon request for payment by UNHCR. Sida estimates that the funds are utilized in close relation to the time of disbursement since UNHCR responds to acute and protracted refugee crises in a large number of refugee situations globally and have a general utilization rate of 98% of the annual contributions. It is Sida's experience that funds available for activities at the country level rarely reaches or exceeds UNHCR's total funding needs. The funding level for UNHCR is generally about 50% of the annual budget. In the exceptional case that UNHCR has not utilized,72010,Yemen,VIII.1.

Migrants generally also have protection needs because of vulnerability related to travel. IOM has also presents a clear link between humanitarian and development issues. IOM works with migration through a multisectoral approach to assist vulnerable migrants with everything from shelter protection to food and non-food support. IOM also has a satisfactory experience of integrating gender conflict and environment / climate in their processes.

31019,Directorate General for Co-operation and Development,United Nations Office of Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs,UN UNOCHA - Office of Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs - PRT,#NULL!,2,Belgium,ODA Grants,Het humanitaire systeem staat voor enorme uitdagingen: de toename van het aantal slachtoffers bij gewapende conflicten het stijgend aantal grote natuurrampen door de klimaatverstoring alsmaar meer vluchtelingen en interne ontheemden de toegenomen complexiteit van crisissen etc. Het best mogelijke humanitair antwoord vormgeven is van groot belang om effectief de meest kwetsbare personen te beschermen.De rol van OCHA het VN-Bureau voor de Co?rdinatie van Humanitaire Zaken is centraal en onmisbaar in het humanitair systeem. De organisatie heeft 5 specifieke doelen: de hulp co?rdineren de noodzaak van humanitaire interventie bepleiten kwalitatieve informatie verzamelen en verspreiden het humanitaire beleid ontwikkelen en humanitaire financiering genereren. Als centrale speler speelt OCHA een vooraanstaande rol in de ori?tatie en de hervorming van het humanitaire systeem.De organisatie beschikt anno 2016 over 2 hoofdzetels (NY en Gen?e) 32 landenkantoren 8 regiokantoren en 3 liaison offices. Hoewel mondiaal actief stuurt de realiteit van de humanitaire noden het zwaartepunt van OCHA's terreinaanwezigheid richting Afrika en het Midden-Oosten. OCHA telt in beide regio's samen 23 landen- en 4 regiokantoren.De 9 OCHA-kantoren van het voorstel van programma liggen in deze twee concentratieregio's (Afrika en het Midden-Oosten): de DRC Burundi de bezette Palestijnse gebieden Niger Yemen Zuid-Soedan Irak Tsjaad en het Regionaal kantoor voor West-Afrika. De situering van deze kantoren stemt overeen met de geografische prioriteiten van de Belgische strategie voor humanitaire hulp (de Regio van de Grote Meren de Sahel en het Midden-Oosten). Alle kantoren worden gekenmerkt door een financieringsdeficit.Op financieel vlak verkeert OCHA in zwaar water. De organisatie wordt steeds gevraagd meer en beter te doen (het belang van zijn mandaat wordt niet betwist). Daardoor groeit het voorziene jaarbudget jaar na jaar (96% per jaar) maar het inkomen stabiliseert sinds 2012 rond 233 miljoen US dollar. Het tekort tussen inkomen en uitgaven loopt dus steeds verder op (50 miljoen USD in 2015) waardoor OCHA jaarlijks zijn reserve dient aan te spreken.De precaire financi?e situatie dreigt te leiden tot de afbouw van OCHA's activiteiten en aanwezigheid op het terrein. Voor 2017 lijken besparingen onafwendbaar.Gezien zijn centrale rol is OCHA's aanwezigheid op het terrein echter essentieel voor een geco?rdineerde en effectieve inzet van de beschikbare humanitaire middelen. In deze logica vraagt OCHA om financi?e steun aan Belgi?teneinde het functioneren van 9 terreinkantoren te blijven garanderen.GENERAL PURPOSE: Faciliteren van een meer effectieve en principi?e humanitaire actie die voldoet aan de noden van de getroffen bevolking.SPECIFIC RESULTS: Resultaat 1: Leiderschap - humanitaire actie wordt geleid door competente en ervaren professionals.Resultaat 2: Contextueel inzicht ? humanitaire besluitvorming is gebaseerd op gemeenschappelijke contextanalyses.Resultaat 3: Planning monitoring en verantwoording ? humanitaire actie wordt gestuurd door een strategische planning gebaseerd op geprioriteerde noden.Resultaat 4: Co?rdinatiemechanismen ? co?rdinatiemechanismen zijn context-specifiek en ondersteunen de effectieve en coherente uitvoering van de hulp.Resultaat 5: Humanitaire financiering ? humanitaire financiering is voorspelbaar tijdig en toegekend op basis van geprioriteerde noden.Resultaat 6: Bescherming en toegang tot hulp ? pleitbezorging en co?rdinatie verzekeren dat personen in crisissituaties worden beschermd en toegang hebben tot de humanitaire hulp die ze nodig hebben.Resultaat 7: Rampenparaatheid ? internationale partners zijn paraat om te antwoorden op humanitaire crisissen zonder uitstel en met de gepaste hulp.SPECIFIC PURPOSE: 1.Een sterkere pleitbezorging voor de bescherming van en de toegang tot de getroffen bevolking in overeenstemming met het internationaal recht het internationaal humanitair recht en d,72050,Yemen,VIII.1.

37928,Global Affairs Canada,United Nations Office of Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs,OCHA - Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs,31-Dec-16,301,Canada,ODA Grants,March 2016- The humanitarian situation in Yemen has deteriorated dramatically since the conflict intensified in late March 2015. Deepening insecurity and violence have taken a heavy toll on civilian lives and have triggered large-scale internal displacement and cross border population movements. Humanitarian partners now estimate that 21.2 million people or 82 per cent of the population require some kind of humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs or protect their fundamental rights. It is also estimated that 14.4 million people are food insecure including 7.6 million severely food insecure; 19.3 million people lack adequate access to clean water or sanitation; 14.1 million people lack sufficient access to healthcare; 3 million children and pregnant or lactating women require malnutrition treatment or preventive services; and 1.8 million children have been out of school since mid-March. Numerous health facilities have stopped functioning due to a lack of fuel supplies and personnel. In addition solid waste removal has come to a halt in several areas and service availability is rapidly contracting due to direct impact of conflict and insufficient resources to pay salaries or maintain services. There are over 2.3 million people who have been displaced in Yemen and an additional 121000 people who have fled the country mainly to Djibouti Ethiopia Somalia and Sudan. With GAC's support the Humanitarian Pooled Fund in Yemen channels resources to humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of millions of people affected by the devastating humanitarian crisis. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving activities by filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and(5) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas of the country by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations. / Mars 2016 - Au Y?en la situation humanitaire s'est consid?ablement d??ior? depuis l'intensification du conflit ?la fin de mars 2015.

38098,Global Affairs Canada,United Nations Office of Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs,OCHA - United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs,31-Dec-17,301,Canada,ODA Grants,March 2017 - Yemen has been suffering from a significant and prolonged humanitarian crisis even before the escalation of the conflict in mid-March 2015. Humanitarian partners estimate that in 2017 there will be 18.8 million people in Yemen who need humanitarian assistance including 10.3 million that require immediate life-saving assistance. More than three million people have been displaced and basic service provision is collapsing. According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network between seven million and ten million people in Yemen have no access to safe sufficient and nutritious food. Malnutrition has soared by more than 60 percent since late 2015 and is affecting over three million people including 460000 severely malnourished children. Many health facilities have been destroyed and humanitarian access remains a significant challenge.With GAC's support the Yemen Humanitarian Pooled Fund channels resources to humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of people affected by the devastating humanitarian crisis. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving activities by filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas of the country by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations./Mars 2017 ?

38104,Global Affairs Canada,United Nations Office of Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs,OCHA - United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs,31-Dec-18,301,Canada,ODA Grants,January 2018 - Yemen has been suffering from a significant and prolonged humanitarian crisis even before the escalation of the conflict in mid-March 2015. There are currently 22.2 million people in Yemen who need humanitarian assistance including 11.3 million that require immediate life-saving assistance. Yemen is experiencing the world's largest man-made food security crisis with over sixty percent of the population (17.8 million) currently food insecure and 8.4 million people relying on food assistance to survive. Malnutrition has soared by over 65% in 2017 and an estimated 400000 children under five years of age are suffering from severe acute malnutrition. More than three million people have been displaced and basic service provision is collapsing. Yemen is also afflicted by one of the largest cholera outbreaks ever recorded with over 1 million suspected cases and 2300 deaths reported since 27 April 2017. Many health facilities have been destroyed or have stopped functioning. Humanitarian access remains a significant challenge.With GAC's support the Yemen Humanitarian Pooled Fund channels resources to humanitarian partners to respond to the critical needs of people affected by the devastating humanitarian crisis. Project activities include: (1) supporting life-saving activities by filling critical funding gaps; (2) promoting needs-based assistance in accordance with humanitarian principles; (3) strengthening coordination of humanitarian assistance; (4) improving the relevance and coherence of humanitarian response by strategically funding priorities as identified under the Humanitarian Response Plan; and (5) expanding the delivery of humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas of the country by partnering with local and international non-governmental organizations./Janvier 2018 ?

39182,Swedish International Development Authority,International NGO,Swedish Red Cross,01-Oct-21,10,Sweden,ODA Grants,On January 27 2017 the Swedish Red Cross (SRC) submitted an application to Sida for the above-mentioned program with an initial budget of 167.5 MSEK for 2017 16 MSEK for 2018 and 16 MSK for 2019. The overall objective of the program is to strengthen the resilience of people and communities to crises and their capacity to recover afterwards and to reduce the risk that people and communities are affected by crises and disasters. A novelty of the new agreement period is that three country-projects (Afghanistan DR Congo and Myanmar) are offered multiyear financing as they are protracted crises with a need for preidictable finansing to secure necessary resources and ensure predictability and contextspecific impact.Funds allocated for 2017 will be disbursed in two different payments after signature of the agreement and after 1 September 2017 following approval of implementation of the action plan established by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies regarding internal management and control. Funds allocated for Ukraine and for a scaled up response in South Sudan (from a budget of 45 MSEK to135 MSEK) will be disbursed after the SRC has provided Sida with and Sida's approval of additional applications for these contexts and after the SRC has demonstrated in written that the corruption case in Ukraine has been investigated and closed and after Sida's approval of the investigation and its recommendations. The SRC is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement made up of 190 Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Federation (IFRC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Sida provides support to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement through two channels: the ICRC and the SRC. The SRC channels most of Sida's support to national societies the IFRC and the ICRC and works in longterm partnership with forteen countries: Cameroon DR Congo Somalia South Sudan Sudan Afghanistan Bangladesh DPRK Myanmar Iraq Palestine Syria Yemen and Ukraine. The SRC's strategic cooperation with partners within the movement - with other National Societies (NS) IFRC and the ICRC ? is essential and gives the SRC the possibility to work at both global and local levels. The SRC is in addition considered to have systems expertise and capacity to strengthen the local capacity of NS to predict and prevent disasters as well as to contribute to rapid humanitarian assistance in sudden crises. The SRC has faced difficulties in demonstrating the humanitarian relevance of the Sida-funded programs as they are often situated between humanitarian action and long-term development. The SRC's new humanitarian strategy 2016-2019 does however put a greater focus on humanitarian operations and this new approach is reflected in the organisation's application 2017-2019. Several programmes with a long-term development focus have been removed in the,72010,Yemen,VIII.1. Emergency Response,SRC AGREEMENT 2017-2019,1.352460000000000,2017

83301,Global Affairs Canada,Donor country-based NGO,CARE Canada,31-Mar-18,301,Canada,ODA Grants,March 2017 - Yemen has been suffering from a significant and prolonged humanitarian crisis even before the escalation of the conflict in mid-March 2015. Humanitarian partners estimate that in 2017 there will be 18.8 million people in Yemen who need humanitarian assistance including 10.3 million that require immediate life-saving assistance. More than 3 million people have been displaced and basic service provision is collapsing. According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network between 7 million and 10 million people in Yemen have no access to safe sufficient and nutritious food. Malnutrition has soared by more than 60 percent since late 2015 and is affecting over 3 million people including 460000 severely malnourished children. Many health facilities have been destroyed and humanitarian access remains a significant challenge.With GAC's support CARE Canada is providing emergency water sanitation hygiene health and livelihoods support for up to 26739 vulnerable individuals in the governorate of Taiz and Ibb. Some of the project components specifically target women and children and all of its components seek to serve the most vulnerable including women-headed households those with special needs and the elderly. Project activities include: (1) providing cash assistance to enable beneficiaries to meet their basic needs; (2) rehabilitating or establishing water sources and latrines in rural communities; and (3) training of community health workers on clean and safe birthing processes./ Mars 2017 ?

83329,Global Affairs Canada,Donor country-based NGO,CARE Canada,31-Mar-17,301,Canada,ODA Grants,March 2016 - The humanitarian situation in Yemen has deteriorated dramatically since the conflict intensified in late March 2015. Deepening insecurity and violence have taken a heavy toll on civilian lives and have triggered large-scale internal displacement and cross border population movements. Humanitarian partners now estimate that 21.2 million people or 82 per cent of the population require some kind of humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs or protect their fundamental rights. It is also estimated that: 14.4 million people are food insecure including 7.6 million severely food insecure; 19.3 million people lack adequate access to clean water or sanitation; 14.1 million people lack sufficient access to healthcare; 3 million children and pregnant or lactating women require malnutrition treatment or preventive services; and 1.8 million children have been out of school since mid-March. Numerous health facilities have stopped functioning due to a lack of fuel supplies and personnel. In addition solid waste removal has come to a halt in several areas and service availability is rapidly contracting due to direct impact of conflict and insufficient resources to pay salaries or maintain services. There are over 2.3 million people who have been displaced in Yemen and an additional 121000 people who have fled the country mainly to Djibouti Ethiopia Somalia and Sudan. With GAC's support CARE Canada is providing emergency water sanitation hygiene and essential relief items for up to 12250 vulnerable individuals in the governorate of Taiz. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating wells; (2) constructing family latrines; (3) providing hygiene kits; and (4) distributing commodity vouchers to targeted vulnerable households. / Mars 2016 - Au Y?en la situation humanitaire s'est consid?ablement d??ior? depuis l'intensification du conflit ?la fin de mars 2015.

115763,Global Affairs Canada,Donor country-based NGO,Norwegian Refugee Council,31-Mar-17,301,Canada,ODA Grants,March 2016 - The humanitarian situation in Yemen has deteriorated dramatically since the conflict intensified in late March 2015. Deepening insecurity and violence have taken a heavy toll on civilian lives and have triggered large-scale internal displacement and cross border population movements. Humanitarian partners now estimate that 21.2 million peopleor 82 per cent of the populationrequire some kind of humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs or protect their fundamental rights. It is also estimated that: 14.4 million people are food insecure including 7.6 million severely food insecure; 19.3 million people lack adequate access to clean water or sanitation; 14.1 million people lack sufficient access to healthcare; 3 million children and pregnant or lactating women require malnutrition treatment or preventive services; and 1.8 million children have been out of school since mid-March. Numerous health facilities have stopped functioning due to a lack of fuel supplies and personnel. In addition solid waste removal has come to a halt in several areas and service availability is rapidly contracting due to direct impact of conflict and insufficient resources to pay salaries or maintain services. There are over 2.3 million people who have been displaced in Yemen and an additional 121000 people who have fled the country mainly to Djibouti Ethiopia Somalia and Sudan. With GAC's support the Norwegian Refugee Council is providing emergency water and livelihoods assistance for up to 11214 vulnerable individuals in Yemen. Project activities include: (1) providing safe drinking water; (2) providing emergency cash assistance to vulnerable households; and (3) providing selected beneficiaries with livelihoods support. / Mars 2016 - Au Y?en la situation humanitaire s'est consid?ablement d??ior? depuis l'intensification du conflit ?la fin de mars 2015.

121335,Global Affairs Canada,Donor country-based NGO,OXFAM - PROVIDER COUNTRY OFFICE,30-Jun-17,301,Canada,ODA Grants,March 2016 - The humanitarian situation in Yemen has deteriorated dramatically since the conflict intensified in late March 2015. Deepening insecurity and violence have taken a heavy toll on civilian lives and have triggered large-scale internal displacement and cross border population movements. Humanitarian partners now estimate that 21.2 million people or 82 per cent of the population require some kind of humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs or protect their fundamental rights. It is also estimated that 14.4 million people are food insecure including 7.6 million severely food insecure; 19.3 million people lack adequate access to clean water or sanitation; 14.1 million people lack sufficient access to healthcare; 3 million children and pregnant or lactating women require malnutrition treatment or preventive services; and 1.8 million children have been out of school since mid-March. Numerous health facilities have stopped functioning due to a lack of fuel supplies and personnel. In addition solid waste removal has come to a halt in several areas and service availability is rapidly contracting due to direct impact of conflict and insufficient resources to pay salaries or maintain services. There are over 2.3 million people who have been displaced in Yemen and an additional 121000 people who have fled the country mainly to Djibouti Ethiopia Somalia and Sudan. With GAC's support the implementing partner is providing emergency water sanitation hygiene and protection services awareness for up to 84000 vulnerable individuals in Southern Yemen. Project activities include: (1) providing safe drinking water; (2) rehabilitating urban water systems; (3) repairing or rehabilitating latrines located in schools and public buildings; (4) distributing hygiene kits; and (5) providing information on protection related services in targeted communities. / Mars 2016 - Au Y?en la situation humanitaire s'est consid?ablement d??ior? depuis l'intensification du conflit ?la fin de mars 2015.

130617,Global Affairs Canada,Donor country-based NGO,Save the Children Canada,31-Mar-18,301,Canada,ODA Grants,March 2017 - Yemen has been suffering from a significant and prolonged humanitarian crisis even before the escalation of the conflict in mid-March 2015. Humanitarian partners estimate that in 2017 there will be 18.8 million people in Yemen who need humanitarian assistance including 10.3 million that require immediate life-saving assistance. More than 3 million people have been displaced and basic service provision is collapsing. According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network between 7 million and 10 million people in Yemen have no access to safe sufficient and nutritious food. Malnutrition has soared by more than 60 percent since late 2015 and is affecting over 3 million people including 460000 severely malnourished children. Many health facilities have been destroyed and humanitarian access remains a significant challenge.With GAC's support Save the Children Canada is providing emergency water sanitation hygiene and nutrition assistance for up to 101273 vulnerable individuals in Taiz governorate. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating gender-sensitive water and sanitation facilities in health clinics and schools; (2) rehabilitating water supply networks; (3) distributing gender-sensitive hygiene kits; and (4) establishing mobile health teams to treat severe acute malnutrition among marginalized boys and girls in remote locations./ Mars 2017 ?

130620,Global Affairs Canada,Donor country-based NGO,Save the Children Canada,31-Mar-17,301,Canada,ODA Grants,March 2016 - The humanitarian situation in Yemen has deteriorated dramatically since the conflict intensified in late March 2015. Deepening insecurity and violence have taken a heavy toll on civilian lives and have triggered large-scale internal displacement and cross border population movements. Humanitarian partners now estimate that 21.2 million people or 82 per cent of the population require some kind of humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs or protect their fundamental rights. It is also estimated that: 14.4 million people are food insecure including 7.6 million severely food insecure; 19.3 million people lack adequate access to clean water or sanitation; 14.1 million people lack sufficient access to healthcare; 3 million children and pregnant or lactating women require malnutrition treatment or preventive services; and 1.8 million children have been out of school since mid-March. Numerous health facilities have stopped functioning due to a lack of fuel supplies and personnel. In addition solid waste removal has come to a halt in several areas and service availability is rapidly contracting due to direct impact of conflict and insufficient resources to pay salaries or maintain services. There are over 2.3 million people who have been displaced in Yemen and an additional 121000 people who have fled the country mainly to Djibouti Ethiopia Somalia and Sudan. With GAC's support Save the Children Canada is providing emergency water sanitation hygiene and nutrition assistance for up to 90228 vulnerable individuals in Taiz governorate. Project activities include: (1) providing safe drinking water; (2) rehabilitating water supply networks and sanitation facilities at schools and health centers; (3) distributing hygiene kits; and (4) establishing infant and young child feeding corners in health facilities. / Mars 2016 - Au Y?en la situation humanitaire s'est consid?ablement d??ior? depuis l'intensification du conflit ?la fin de mars 2015.

In this appraisal Sida makes the assessment that the proposed programme is relevant in relation to the Strategy for Sweden's Humanitarian Assistance provided through Sida 2017 - 2020 and that a three-year agreement on strategic partnership should be entered into between Sida and SMC for the period 1 April 2017 - 31 March 2020.In its proposal for 2017 SMC has applied for a total amount of 465 million SEK which includes 1) work in six countries (355 million SEK); 2) interventions through the Rapid Response Mechanism (10 million SEK); and 3) capacity development support (1 million SEK). During 2017 SMC proposes to work with four member organizations which are ADRA (Adventist Development and Relief Agency) IAS (International Aid Services) CCS (Christian Council of Sweden) and PMU (Pingsmissionens utvecklingssamarbete). SMC founded in 1912 is an ecumenical membership-based organization with 35 member organizations who are active in 46 countries. The organization is engaged in both development work and humanitarian assistance and became a framework organization for Sida/CIVSAM already in 1980 while the strategic partnership with Sida in terms of humanitarian assistance was initiated as late as 2014. The 35 members are Swedish churches and Christian organizations with long histories of international work - the role of SMC is generally to support facilitate and coordinate these partner organizations and their local partners' work.,72010,Yemen,VIII.1.

134844,Global Affairs Canada,International NGO,ACF - Action Against Hunger - France,31-Mar-17,301,Canada,ODA Grants,March 2016 - The situation in Yemen has deteriorated dramatically since the conflict intensified in late March 2015. Deepening insecurity and violence have taken a heavy toll on civilian lives and have triggered large-scale internal displacement and cross border population movements. Humanitarian partners now estimate that 21.2 million people - or 82 per cent of the population - require some kind of humanitarian assistance to meet their basic needs or protect their fundamental rights. Partners estimate that: 14.4 million people are food insecure including 7.6 million severely food insecure; 19.3 million people lack adequate access to clean water or sanitation; 14.1 million people lack sufficient access to healthcare; 3 million children and pregnant or lactating women require malnutrition treatment or preventive services; and 1.8 million children have been out of school since mid-March. Numerous health facilities have stopped functioning due to a lack of fuel supplies and personnel. In addition solid waste removal has come to a halt in several areas and service availability is rapidly contracting due to direct impact of conflict and insufficient resources to pay salaries or maintain services. There are over 2.3 million people who have been displaced in Yemen and an additional 121000 people who have fled the country mainly to Djibouti Ethiopia Somalia and Sudan. With GAC's support ACF is providing essential relief items and livelihoods support for up to 10500 vulnerable individuals in the governorates of Abyan Al Hudaydah and Lahj. Project activities include: (1) identifying the most vulnerable households; (2) distributing multi-purpose emergency cash assistance to the most vulnerable households; (3) providing livelihoods support; and (4) monitoring the assistance provided.,72010,Yemen,VIII.1.

134868,Global Affairs Canada,International NGO,Action Against Hunger (ACF) - France,31-Mar-19,301,Canada,ODA Grants,March 2017 - Yemen has been suffering from a significant and prolonged humanitarian crisis even before the escalation of the conflict in mid-March 2015. Humanitarian partners estimate that in 2017 there will be 18.8 million people in Yemen who need humanitarian assistance including 10.3 million that require immediate life-saving assistance. More than 3 million people have been displaced and basic service provision is collapsing. According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network between 7 million and 10 million people in Yemen have no access to safe sufficient and nutritious food. Malnutrition has soared by more than 60 percent since late 2015 and is affecting over 3 million people including 460000 severely malnourished children. Many health facilities have been destroyed and humanitarian access remains a significant challenge.With GAC's support Action Against Hunger Canada is providing emergency water sanitation hygiene and livelihoods support for up to 10900 vulnerable individuals with a particular focus on children under five years of age and women and girls in the governorates of Lahj and Abyan. Project activities include: (1) rehabilitating water sources; (2) empowering households to meet their basic needs; and (3) distributing gender-sensitive hygiene kits./ Mars 2017 ?

The decision is made in accordance with Sida's contribution management rule paragraph 3.11.3 and corresponds to the second year of a three year agreement.In accordance with Sida's humanitarian allocation process 2018 Sida proposes to support NRC's humanitarian programs in the following 21 countries; Afghanistan Cameroon Central African Republic Democratic Republic of Congo Eritrea Ethiopia Iran Iraq Jordan Kenya Lebanon Libya Mali Nigeria Palestine Somalia South Sudan Syrian Arab Republic Uganda Ukraine and Yemen. Sida will contribute with an unearmarked allocation per country which will give NRC the flexibility to meet the most acute humanitarian needs in ever-changing contexts. However in the specific case of Palestine Sida will earmark the contribution to the ICLA-component as this sector is considered high priority and as contributory to the HRPs focus on protection. The support to Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo is suggested to span over a two-year period. This is in line with Sida's ambition to increase our partner's predictability and allow for their long-term planning and alignment with a multi-year HRP.Sida assesses NRC's country programs as relevant in relation to the Swedish strategy for humanitarian assistance 2017-2020 as well as the humanitarian needs identified in Sida's humanitarian crises analyses for 2018. Sida is also suggesting a multi-year contribution to NRC's Rapid Response Mechanism to allow for a timely response to sudden onset situations or escalating crises. Furthermore Sida suggests a two-year financial contribution to the NRC-led Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) which strives to increase knowledge on the needs of internally displaced and one-year contributions to the NRC/NORCAP managed project Strengthening capacity for use of cash- and market based responses in humanitarian action to NRC's internal work on 'Digital Transformation' and to NRC's work on humanitarian policy which includes work to strengthen the global humanitarian system and NGO participation in the system.Sida also proposes to channel funds through NRC for the support of three NGO platforms; the Jordan INGO Forum (JIF) the Lebanon Humanitarian INGO Forum (LHIF) and the International Association of Development Agencies (AIDA). In regard to AIDA the Consulate General in Jerusalem has the intention to provide support for AIDA within the framework of the cooperation strategy for Palestine. Efficiency gains can be achieved by providing the support through the NRC-Sida humanitarian unit cooperation agreement and it is thus suggested that Sida/HUM channels this limited development funding with funding delegated from Palestine Strategy decision number XXX XXXXNRC's target group is mainly comprised of refugees and internally displaced per,72010,Yemen,VIII.1.
